"""Abstractions for quantum vectors and operators.

Quantum mechanics involves a lot of linear algebra on vector spaces that often
have a preferred tensor-product factorization. Tensor networks are a natural
way to represent vectors and operators (matrices) involving these spaces. Hence
we provide some simple abstractions to ease linear algebra operations in which
the vectors and operators are represented by tensor networks.
