  """Computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a tensor.

  The SVD is performed by treating the tensor as a matrix, with an effective
  left (row) index resulting from combining the axes `tensor.shape[:pivot_axis]`
  and an effective right (column) index resulting from combining the axes
  `tensor.shape[pivot_axis:]`.

  For example, if `tensor` had a shape (2, 3, 4, 5) and `pivot_axis` was 2, then
  `u` would have shape (2, 3, 6), `s` would have shape (6), and `vh` would
  have shape (6, 4, 5).

  If `max_singular_values` is set to an integer, the SVD is truncated to keep
  at most this many singular values.

  If `max_truncation_error > 0`, as many singular values will be truncated as
  possible, so that the truncation error (the norm of discarded singular
  values) is at most `max_truncation_error`.
  If `relative` is set `True` then `max_truncation_err` is understood
  relative to the largest singular value.

  If both `max_singular_values` snd `max_truncation_error` are specified, the
  number of retained singular values will be
  `min(max_singular_values, nsv_auto_trunc)`, where `nsv_auto_trunc` is the
  number of singular values that must be kept to maintain a truncation error
  smaller than `max_truncation_error`.

  The output consists of three tensors `u, s, vh` such that:
  ```python
    u[i1,...,iN, j] * s[j] * vh[j, k1,...,kM] == tensor[i1,...,iN, k1,...,kM]
  ```
  Note that the output ordering matches numpy.linalg.svd rather than tf.svd.

  Args:
    tf: The tensorflow module.
    tensor: A tensor to be decomposed.
    pivot_axis: Where to split the tensor's axes before flattening into a
      matrix.
    max_singular_values: The number of singular values to keep, or `None` to
      keep them all.
    max_truncation_error: The maximum allowed truncation error or `None` to not
      do any truncation.
    relative: Multiply `max_truncation_err` with the largest singular value.

  Returns:
    u: Left tensor factor.
    s: Vector of ordered singular values from largest to smallest.
    vh: Right tensor factor.
    s_rest: Vector of discarded singular values (length zero if no
            truncation).
