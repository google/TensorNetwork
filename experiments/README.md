# Experiments

The Experiments folder is not part of the core TensorNetwork library, but is a central location for projects that move beyond simple examples in scope and complexity. Some aspects of some experiments may eventually be incorporated into the library if they provide useful functionality.

PRs to Experiments are welcome, but we may decide to move or otherwise repurpose the folder at a later date. We are also not applying the same coding standards to these experiments as we do to the library itself. If there is something in an experiment that is very useful for you, please post an issue so that we can add it into the library!
