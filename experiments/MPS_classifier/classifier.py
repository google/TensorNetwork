"""TensorNetwork implementation of MPS image classfier.

The idea of using Matrix Product States for image classification was introduced
by Stoudenmire and Schwab in arXiv:1605.05775. This codes provides a
TensorNetwork / TensorFlow implementation of this idea. The implementation
differs from the original in various aspects with the most important being the
optimization part. In the original work as sweeping (DMRG inspired) algorithm
was used, while here we exploit the automatic differentation which is built-in
in machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow. Therefore we only need to
code the forward (prediction) part of the algorithm which is equivalent to
calculating the inner product between the data vector and the MPS vector.
More details can be found in the paper `TensorNetwork for Machine Learning` and
the implementation was inspired by jemisjoky/TorchMPS.

This file contains MatrixProductState and Environment classes which are
described in their definitions. The first defines the forward pass we need in
order to train and predict, while the latter is used as a utility to perform
the inner product calculations required.

  Perform the core calculation required for the inner product by building the
  relevant TensorNetwork. An environment consists of a boundary vector of shape
  (d_phys, d_bond) and the MPS matrices of shape (d_phys, d_bond, d_bond).
  Note that the MPS matrices are stored as a tensor of shape
  (n_sites, d_phys, d_bond, d_bond), namely with an additional "space" index
  for efficiency.  Upon contracting each environment with the corresponding
  data vector part, we contract the "space" index using
  `batchtensornetwork.pairwise_reduction` which performs a parallelized
  contraction of the MPS matrices which was found to be more efficient when
  implementing the automatic gradient optimization. We note that this type of
  contraction works because the input data corresponds to a product
  (non-entangled) state. Finally the result of the "space" index contraction
  is contracted with the boundary to give a tensor of shape (n_batch, d_bond).
